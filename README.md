# Learning Computer Vision
## Introduction
- `Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data.`
- It has applications in various domains such as healthcare, automotive, robotics, and more.
- This guide will introduce you to basic computer vision concepts and techniques using Python libraries such as [open cv](https://opencv.org/) and deep learning frameworks.
